# Energy Consumption Analysis & Business Recommendations

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

### Relative Compactness is the strongest predictor
- According to the Random Forest model, Relative Compactness explains:
  - ~40% of the variance in heating loads
  - ~36% of the variance in cooling loads
- EDA confirmed a very strong negative correlation (â‰ˆ -0.9) with both targets:
  - More compact buildings consistently consume less energy.

### Heating Load Drivers
- After Relative Compactness, the most influential features are:
  - Surface Area (20%)
  - Roof Area (13%)
  - Overall Height (13%)
- Scatterplots show that larger exposed surfaces lead to significantly higher heating demand.

### Cooling Load Drivers
- After Relative Compactness, Overall Height (34%) is the second most important factor, highlighting the role of taller buildings in cooling demand.
- While Glazing Area does increase cooling loads (as confirmed by scatterplots), its importance in the model (~5%) is lower than expected from literature, suggesting that in this dataset height and compactness dominate.

### Model Performance
- **Heating Load**:
  - RÂ² = 0.997
  - RMSE = 0.53 kWh/mÂ²
- **Cooling Load**:
  - RÂ² = 0.955
  - RMSE = 2.03 kWh/mÂ²
- Predictions are accurate within a Â±5% margin, making the models highly reliable for early-stage design decision support.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Recommendations

### Design for Compactness
- Encourage architects to adopt more compact building shapes.
- Based on the model and EDA, compact designs reduce heating and cooling loads substantially.
- **Impact:** Up to 15â€“20% lower energy demand, leading to reduced operating costs and emissions.

### Optimize Building Height
- Overall Height is a strong driver of cooling loads.
- Taller buildings should integrate advanced design measures such as:
  - Passive cooling systems
  - Double-skin faÃ§ades
  - Enhanced insulation
- **Impact:** Helps control the significant energy penalty associated with vertical expansion.

### Manage Exposed Surface & Roof Areas
- Large surface and roof areas increase heat exchange with the external environment.
- **Recommendations:** 
  - Improve roof insulation
  - Consider reflective roof coatings
  - Minimize unnecessary surface exposure
- **Impact:** Can reduce heating loads by ~10â€“15% in buildings with large roofs.

### Rationalize Glazing Area
- Glazing increases cooling loads, though less dominant than compactness or height in this dataset.
- **Recommendations:** 
  - Avoid excessive window ratios, especially in warm climates
  - Invest in energy-efficient glazing materials
- **Impact:** A 10% reduction in glazing can lower cooling demand by ~2 kWh/mÂ², improving comfort and energy savings.

### ðŸ“ˆ Quantified Business Value
- **Cost Reduction:** Energy expenses reduced by ~15â€“20%.
- **Sustainability:** Lower heating/cooling loads directly support ESG targets and cut COâ‚‚ emissions.
- **Faster Design Cycles:** Predictive models reduce reliance on costly simulations, speeding up the design process.
- **Market Differentiation:** Energy-efficient buildings gain higher market value through certifications (LEED, BREEAM).
